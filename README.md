# TextDraw Designer

A web-based visual editor for creating SA-MP and open.mp TextDraws. Design your HUD directly in the browser and export ready-to-paste Pawn code, no server required.

## Why this exists

Most TextDraw editors are either in-game tools that require running a SA-MP server, or basic web tools with limited features. This one runs entirely in the browser, has a proper layer system, supports multiple background images (layers) as a reference, and exports clean Pawn code for both Global and Player TextDraws.
